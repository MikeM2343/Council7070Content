When you join the Knights of Columbus and take the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Degrees, you are joining a Council, such as our St. Peter Council #7070. When you take the 4th Degree you join an Assembly, which is a separate organization from the Council, but still part of the Knights of Columbus.

The Council is primarily responsible for implementing the Programs as listed in [Who are the Knights](/Membership/WhoAreTheKnights) and [Our Council Programs](/Programs). The Assembly, on the other hand is primarily responsible for providing Colour Guards or Honour Guards in their distinct regalia at civic and Church events, or standing in respect at the funerals of members or during adoration of the Eucharist.

Once a member of a Council joins the 4th Degree, they can join any Assembly they choose. Members of St. Peter Council belong to both the St. Joseph Assembly #0005 and Fr. Patrick McQuaid Assembly #2293.
