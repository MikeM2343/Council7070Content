### The Columbus Club Mandate

The Columbus Club's mandate is to financially support the Knight of Columbus, providing general funds for the Knights to use for operational issues.

The Columbus Club allocates 10% of charitable funds (bingo and casino revenue) to the Knights of Columbus and distributes these monies to charitable organizations designated by, and on behalf of, the Knights. The distribution of funds must fall within the guidelines and approval of the Attorney General'ss Department.

Charitable requests must support organizations in Millwoods as first priority, second priority is given to organizations in the City of Edmonton and the third priority is to support organizations within the Province of Alberta (if sufficient funds are available).
