    - You will not belong to a Council but will get emails and physical mail including the Columbia magazine.
    - You will be contacted to join a local Council so that you can meet people and get involved in the programs as listed below.
    - You *will* be able to attend our local St. Peter Council [Meetings](/Membership/Meetings), but you *will not* be allowed to vote.

2. You can join a Council directly
    - This involves going through a ceremony.  (Depending on circumstances, this may either be virtual or in-person).
    - You will become part of a real Council that implements programs and activities on a regular basis.
    - As a full member of St. Peter Council #7070 you will now have voting privileges at our [Council Meetings](/Membership/Meetings)
