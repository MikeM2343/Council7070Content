The annual Council dues are $40, but are pro-rated if you are joining the Council in the middle of the year.  Dues notices are sent out in November and are due on January 1st.  Once you pay your dues, you will receive your travelling card which is required to attend [meetings](/Membership/Meetings).

You can pay your dues with Interac e-Transfer, cash, cheque (made payable to Knights of Columbus Council #7070), or bingo coupons earned by working bingos.
- If paying by Interac e-Transfer
    - Send the e-Transfer to jcamile@telusplanet.net.  There is no need to include a security question or answer because the funds are automatically deposited.
    - Please be sure to include your name in the comments section because it is not always easy to identify you by the email that you are sending the dues from.
- If paying by cash, cheque or bingo coupons, you can either
    - Mail them directly to Financial Secretary, Brother Camile Joly at 521 Stewart Crescent SW, Edmonton, AB  T6X 0A8. Please do not send cash in the mail.
    - Put them in a sealed envelope with your name on it and drop them off either:
      - In the basket during the collection at St. Theresa's
      - At the office at [St. Theresa's Church](/OurCouncil/ParishInformation)

Preferably, dues will be paid all at once, but can also be paid in installments if you are experiencing financial issues.  All conversations will be held in strictest confidence.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact Financial Secretary, Brother Camile Joly at:
