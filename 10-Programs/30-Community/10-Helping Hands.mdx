This Columbian year (July through June) our council has done the following:
- After being infected with covid 19, one of our brother Knights developed pneumonia that destroyed his
lungs and required a double lung transplant. While recovering Council 7070 members banded together
and raised $2950 (revision) in donations to help his family with living expenses.
- Helping to facilitate a move to an extended care home, Council 7070 members planned, sorted, donated
and relocated a brother Knight`s personal belongings to his new home.
- St Peter Council 7070 and Eritrean Community Council 17494 worked together to collect 9 large bags of
gently used adult winter coats on the weekend of World Sunday of the Poor. They were presented to Fr.
Blom, Associate Pastor of Sacred Heart Catholic Parish of the First Peoples in Edmonton AB.
