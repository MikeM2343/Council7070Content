“Spring is HERE - yay!” Green grass and GOLF too!
FYI - Knights, Ladies &amp; friends league at Countryside…

We have received confirmation that our regular Tuesday afternoon Knights &
friends league golf at Countryside Woodlands (10 holes) which will officially begin
on Tues. either May 6 th or 13 th depending on the weather. Whether you’re a “Duffer”
or a “Pro” you are invited. Book for 1-4 as we make up teams when we get there.

Same as previous years. We have been given the time frame of **1:25pm – 2:05 pm.**
We will be able to book on line or by phone as this tee time is reserved for Knights
&amp; friends only.  You will receive a reminder from Countryside via e-mail approx. 1
week prior. We will need to book early each week by Saturday, otherwise any
unused tee time slots will be cancelled and given to the public as of Sunday pm.

18 holes are still available but you will need to book separately like you did last
year. Also 5:00pm on the Prairies will also be available for a couple of foursomes if
required. After golf come join the gang on the 19 th hole in the Clubhouse or patio
for some great Fraternalism, a Beer, and you can Brag or BS about your score!!

Senior rates apply to anyone over the age +55. Take advantage of their “Flex-
Pass”!
