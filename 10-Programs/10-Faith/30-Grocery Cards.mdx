Since the pandemic started, grocery cards are not being sold before and after Masses
anymore, but you can still drop by the office at St. Theresa's and purchase them.

### How do the Grocery Cards work?

St. Theresa's purchases various cards in bulk at a discount from 4% to 10%. When you purchase a card, you can use the entire value of the card
to purchase groceries, gas, meals, etc. until the card is all used up. (You do not have to use the entire value of the card at once.)
St. Theresa's then gets to keep that discounted difference, which ends up being a donation at no cost to you.

### Where Can I Use the Cards?

You can use the cards to purchase groceries, gas (at participating retailers such as Coop or Superstore) and meals, such as Tim Hortons and various other restaurants.
The cards are available in denominations of $100, $50 or $25, except where noted. Currently, there are gift cards available for:

- Superstore
- Sobeys/Safeway/FreshCo
- Co-op
- SaveOn Foods
- Tim Hortons ($10 and $25)
- Boston Pizza ($25 and $50)
- A combination card ($25) that can be used for the following restaurants:
  - Swiss Chalet
  - Montana's
  - Kelsey's
  - East Side Marios
  - Harvey's
  - Fionn MacCools
  - Original Joe's
  - and more...
