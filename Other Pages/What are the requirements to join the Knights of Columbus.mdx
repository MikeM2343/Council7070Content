Membership in the Knights of Columbus is open to men 18 years of age or older,
who are practical (that is, practicing) Catholics in union with the Holy See.

### What is a practical Catholic in union with the Holy See?

A practical Catholic accepts the teaching authority of the Catholic Church
on matter of faith and morals, aspires to live in accord with the precepts
of the Catholic Church, and is in good standing in the Catholic Church.

### The Precepts of the Catholic Church [^1]

The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory character of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant to guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor:

1. You shall attend mass on Sundays and on holy days of obligation and rest from servile labour.
> We must “sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the Lord” (Sunday), as well as the principal feast days, known as [Catholic holy days of obligation](http://www.beginningcatholic.com/catholic-holy-days-of-obligation). This requires attending Mass, “and by resting from those works and activities which could impede such a sanctification of these days.
2. You shall confess your sins at least once a year.
> We must prepare for the Eucharist by means of the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession). This sacrament “continues Baptism’s work of conversion and forgiveness.
3. You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season.
>This “guarantees as a minimum the reception of the Lord’s Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy.
4. You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the Church.
> The fourth precept ensures the times of ascesis and penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and help us acquire mastery over our instincts and freedom of heart. See below for more about fasting & abstinence.
5. You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church.
> The fifth precept means that the faithful are obliged to assist with the material needs of the Church, each according to his own ability.

### More about fasting & abstinence
One of the precepts of the Catholic Church requires fasting & abstinence as signs of repentance. Repentance means to turn away from sin and turn back to God.

Catholic spirituality traditionally includes in repentance some form of penance. Penance means some practice that lets us express sorrow for our sins and helps repair the damage that sin has caused.

Penance gives us important practice in resisting temptation, thereby strengthening us. It greatly strengthens a number of virtues, especially charity, and it greatly enriches life.

The Catholic Church has two official forms of penitential practices: fasting and abstinence. These are so important that they’re one of the precepts of the Catholic Church.

Fasting is reducing the amount of food you eat below normal levels. Specifically, on fast days you may eat one full meal and two smaller meals, but those two smaller together should not exceed the amount of the normal meal. Snacking is also prohibited on fast days.

All Catholics age 18 to 59 are required to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. You are excused from fasting if you have a legitimate need to eat a normal amount of food on fast days. This includes:
- The sick or infirm, including handicapped or mentally ill people who need the nourishment or cannot make a free choice to fast
- Pregnant or nursing women
- Some manual laborers

Abstinence means not eating meat (fish is not considered meat in this case). All Catholics 14 and older are required to observe abstinence on these days:
- Ash Wednesday, Good Friday (the Friday before Easter), and all Fridays in Lent.
- Outside the U.S., this is required on all Fridays of the year, in honor of the Passion of Jesus on Good Friday.
- In the U.S., it is still strongly recommended to observe Friday abstinence outside of Lent, but Catholics may choose to substitute another penitential practice or act of charity for these days.

Note that the duty to perform the tasks of your state in life takes precedence over the law of fasting in the precepts of the Catholic Church. If fasting honestly causes you to be unable to fulfill your required tasks, it is uncharitable to fast — the law of fasting would not apply in this case. (Consult with a priest if this is a concern to you.)
