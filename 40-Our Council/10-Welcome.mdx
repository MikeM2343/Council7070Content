Dear Worthy Brother Knights, worthy Chaplain & entire families

As we continue our journey in faith, service and fraternity, I am truly honored to serve as your Grand Knight for the past years until present.

Our mission, grounded in the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity and Patriotism, calls us to be active stewards of both our community and the Church. Together, we have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact, not only by serving those in need but by growing stronger in our faith and commitment to each other.

Let us remember that as Knights, we are part of something much larger than ourselves - a worldwide brotherhood of men who are dedicated to supporting one another, our families, and our communities. The work we do reflects the love of Christ and strengthens the foundation of our parish and our nation.

I encourage all of you to continue engaging in the charitable works and events that define our Council. Whether it's through volunteering, fundraising or simply supporting one another, each of us plays a vital role in fulfilling our mission.

Thank you for your dedication to the Order and for your unwavering commitment to our shared ideals. 

I'm looking forward to working alongside each of you as we serve God, Church, and Community.

Vivat Jesus!
Sir Knight, Jesse Cesar
