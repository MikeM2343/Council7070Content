Welcome to St. Peter Council
Dear Worthy Brother Knights,
I would like to introduce myself as your Grand Knight for the 2025/2026 Columbian year. My name is Patrick Power. 
It is a privilege to assume the role of Grand Knight once again as we collectively pursue our commitments to faith, service, and fraternity.
Our mission, grounded in the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity and Patriotism, calls us to be active stewards of both our Community and the Church. Working together, we can make a real difference by supporting those in need and strengthening our faith and unity.
As Knights, we belong to a global fraternity committed to supporting each other, our families, and our communities. The work we do reflects the love of Christ and strengthens the foundation of our St. Theresaâ€™s Parish.

Our KC Council meetings take place on the third Wednesday of each month at 7:30 p.m. in our KC/CC hall, 2947- 66th street in the Cedar Professional Village. (No meetings in July/Aug.) The best way to get anything out of your membership in the Knights is to get involved. There is something for everyone and we all work as a team, so do not be a stranger.
I encourage all of you to continue engaging in the charitable works and events that define our Council. Whether it is through volunteering, fundraising or simply supporting one another, each of us plays a vital role in fulfilling our mission.
Thank you for your dedication to the Order and for your unwavering commitment to our shared ideals.
I am looking forward to working alongside each of you as we serve God, Church, and Community.
Vivat Jesus!
Fraternally, 

Brother Patrick Power
Grand Knight
