title: Welcome to St. Peter Council #7070
summary: A Welcome from our Grand Knight
---

I would like to introduce myself as your Grand Knight for the 2021/2022 Columbian year. My name is Nick Kondra. To many of you, I don't need an introduction as I am an honorary life member. But as Covid has occupied our life for almost the last two years, and many new members have joined both online and recently through some live exemplifications, we haven't had the opportunity to meet in person. 

Meeting virtually just isn't the same but we still are implementing many of our programs.  
- [Family prayer night](/Programs/Family/FamilyPrayerNight) on Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
- We've help a Brother Knight move to a seniors residence 
- Coats for Kids 
- Supporting our Seminarians 
- A Chapter initiative of Keeping Christ in Christmas

We do meet virtually on the second Wednesday of the month for a planning meeting and all are welcome (not only the executive) to share ideas.  Our general meetings are on the third Wednesday of the month. Both are at 7:30 p.m.  The best way to get anything out of your membership in the Knights is to get involved.  There's something for everyone and our older members are very willing to help, so don't be a stranger . 

If you need any information please don't hesitate to contact me, or if there's a Brother in need l can be contacted at 780-446-0055 or at nkondra@shaw.ca.

Hoping to hear from you,

Brother Nick Kondra<br/>
Grand Knight
