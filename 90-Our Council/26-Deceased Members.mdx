### ** A Prayer for Deceased Members**

Eternal rest grant unto them. O Lord, and let perpetual light shine
upon them. May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.

Like the seed buried in the ground. You have produced the harvest
of eternal life for us; make us always dead to sin and alive to God.
