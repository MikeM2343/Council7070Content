KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS EMBLEM

The emblem of the Order dates from the second Supreme Council meeting May 12, 1883,
when it was designed by James T. Mullen, who was then Supreme Knight. A quick glance
at the emblem indicates a shield mounted upon the Formee Cross. The shield is that
associated with a medieval Knight. The Formee Cross is the representation of a
traditionally artistic design of the Cross of Christ through which all graces of
redemption were procured for mankind. This then represents the Catholic spirit of
the Order. Mounted on the shield are three objects: a fasces standing vertically,
and, crossed behind it, an anchor and a dagger or short sword. The fasces from Roman
days is symbolic of authority which must exist in any tightly-bonded and efficiently
operating organization. The anchor is the mariner's symbol for Columbus, patron of
the Order, while the short sword or dagger was the weapon of the Knight when engaged
upon an errand of mercy. Thus, the shield expresses Catholic Knighthood in organized
merciful action, and with the letters,
K. of C., it proclaims this specific form of
activity. The red, white and blue in the background of the shield and the foreground
of the Cross of Malta are the colors of our country.
As such, red is the symbol of stout-hearted courage, of pulsing activity and a full
measure of devotion. Blue is the symbol of hope, of calm tranquility under God and of
confidence in the protection of our country.

White is the symbol of nobility of purpose, of purity of aim and of crucible-tried ideals
to be carried out. But there is another symbolism of color in red, white and blue.
This is the ecclesiastical symbolism in which red becomes the reflection of the drips
of Christ's redemptive blood shed upon Calvary, and of the martyr's bloodshed in defense of the faith.

Red then is the symbol of Faith, of belief in Christ, in the Redemption and in the knowledge
and love of Jesus Christ.

White is the color of the Eucharistic Host, pledge of God's Eucharistic presence among men,
of the infinite love God has for man and the overwhelming affection which the God-man has for
each individual. White then is the symbol of Christ-like Charity.

Blue is the color of Our Lady's mantle, in which she wrapped her beloved Son, through Whom
came salvation to a sinful world. Blue is then the symbol of Hope
