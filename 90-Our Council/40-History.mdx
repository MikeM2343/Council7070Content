### St. Peter Council 7070

St. Peter Council 7070 came to be on March 10, 1978. It had a starting membership of
33 dedicated men. Lead by Al Mageau, the first Grand Knight, and under the guidance
of Fr. John McNeil, from these humble beginnings, 7070 went on to become a council
with a membership today of 228. The council is very active in St. Theresa's parish,
the largest parish in the City of Edmonton. In fact one priest recently expressed
his appreciation by saying 'you can't swing a cat around in this church without
hitting a Knight'. This of course prompted the council to get him a stuffed cat to
swing.

We came from humble beginnings. The first meetings were held in St. Hilda's School.
Through the formation of the Columbus Club in July 1982 St. Peter Council was able
to build on its assets mainly through bingos and casinos. This eventually allowed
us to purchase property for a new hall in 1992 at 2947 66 St NW. This is the current
location of our home.

And an active council it is. 7070 has won numerous awards, Star Council, Pennies for
Heaven, and best Council Bulletin have all been won many times with different
members being key players. In 2006 our council sent 10 people down to Jamaica
to build homes for the poor and get an understanding of the problems Jamaica faces.
This venture was an inspiration to the council and earned us 3rd place in the
International Service Program Award for 2006-07. The legacy continues with the
5th team organizing to go down in the near future.

We are also involved in charities closer to home. Each year the council takes on
a huge percentage of the Christmas Bureau hamper deliveries. Delivering to the needy
all across Edmonton but also taking care of the majority of the Millwoods deliveries.
Our members are also very active in the St. Vincent de Paul society giving out
furniture to the less fortunate in southern Edmonton. When the Grey Nuns Hospital
was open in Millwoods in 1988, 7070 raised a large portion of the $43,000 for a
Handicap Bus to help transport patients. For many years St. Peter Council had teamed
with Father Bonner Council to manage the Walk Run and Roll for Spinal Cord research.

7070 takes an active role in the lives of seniors too. During most months of the
year, assistance is given to a group of seniors at Shepherd's Care to allow them
to enjoy an afternoon of bingo. This event is highly appreciated by both the seniors
and the knights involved.

On the other end of the spectrum 7070 has both a basketball freethrow and soccer
freekick. The soccer freekick is still getting going but there are hopes that it
will soon begin to grow.

The Council members are active in all church ministries at St. Theresa's: Ushers,
Proclaimers, Adult Servers, Eucharistic Ministers and even junior servers would
suffer if the members of 7070 were not so active. Though I am not sure how we manage
to get past the age limit for junior servers, I have seen brothers doing the juniors
duties. Other activities include a monthly pancake breakfast in MacNeil hall,
readings of the Way of the Cross during lent, a living Rosary after selected weekly
masses, a yearly memorial mass and the selling of Grocery/Gas cards to raise funds
for our parish.

The Grocery/Gas card program has been a huge success and has helped to pay off
renovations of St. Theresa's Church, the building of a new home for our parish
priests, and has contributed to the beginnings of the newly formed parish of
Corpus Christi. Members of our council were heavily involved in the manpower of
all these projects.

St. Peter's Columbus club tries to support local charities that are not main stream
charities. Camp Nakamun, Our Lady of Victory camp and the Marian Centre are regular
beneficiaries. It is also from this arm that money is made available to help support
the teams going to Jamaica.

When the call came to raise funds for the new seminary once again this council
proved its worth. Using our 'Pancakes for a Purpose' theme, over $15,000 dollars
were raised to support the seminary and college's Cornerstone of Faith campaign.
Most of this money came from the pancakes sold to parishioners of St. Theresa's.
Not only was this three times the amount pledged by the council, but I believe it
was also the most money donated by a council. These breakfasts were not only a
financial success but also helped in building community within our large and
diverse parish.

Our council logo causes a lot of interest. It is a St. Peter's cross which is
'upside down' compared to the Cross of Jesus. This is because Tradition has it
that St. Peter was crucified upside down. It was designed by one of the founding
members, Fred Rumsey.

To sum up, this is a strong, vibrant council that has not forgotten how to have
fun making wonderful things happen to support the kingdom of God.
